          <h2>What Exactly Is Alternative Medicine?</h2>
  <p>Alternative medicine is a term that describes medical treatments that are used instead of traditional (mainstream) therapies.
  Some people also refer to it as “integrative,” or “complementary” medicine. About 40% of adults in the United States say they use
  some form of alternative medicine.
	Traditional medicine (also known as indigenous or folk medicine) comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed
	over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines traditional medicine
	as "the sum total of the knowledge, skills, and practices based on the theories, beliefs, and experiences indigenous to different cultures,
	whether explicable or not, used in the maintenance of health as well as in the prevention, diagnosis, improvement or treatment of physical and
	mental illness".
	In some Asian and African countries, up to 80% of the population relies on traditional medicine for their primary health care needs.
	When adopted outside its traditional culture, traditional medicine is often considered a form of alternative medicine. Practices known as
	traditional medicines include traditional European medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, traditional Korean medicine, traditional African medicine,
	Ayurveda, Siddha medicine, Unani, ancient Iranian Medicine, Iranian (Persian), Islamic medicine, Muti, and Ifá. Scientific disciplines which study
	traditional medicine include herbalism, ethnomedicine, ethnobotany, and medical anthropology.</p>
  <h2>Why Traditional Medicine?</h2>
  <p>Modern medicine has its challenges. Medical treatment, or even diagnostic examination, can cause adverse effects in a patient.
  These effects are known as iatrogenic disease, and they can be relatively minor--or they can be complex and life threatening,
  claiming more than 50,000 lives each year. Plus, when it comes to preventing disease and treating chronic illnesses, modern medicine
  continues to fall short.
	Many of the practitioners of modern allopathic medicine realize the limitations of their own science, and for that reason,
	they are turning to other systems of medicine that have stood the test of time. Ayurveda is one such system. Although it came to prominence
	in the western world during the last two decades, this ancient medical system has been in practice for more than 5,000 years. This system
	is based not upon disease alone but upon the concept of perfect health.
	Traditional Medicine is a safe alternative approach, a medical system that focuses on preventing disease and treating its root causes.
	It provides specific advice on proper diet and lifestyle, as well as cleansing and detoxification programs. And unlike modern allopathic drugs,
	its treatments are tailored to the specific constitution and imbalances of each individual person. Following these guidelines can help prevent
	future heart attacks, stroke paralysis, or even cancer. It is also useful for chronic conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and sciatica,
	improving quality of life in a way that modern medicine has not managed to do. In addition all this, traditional medicine is easily accessible,
	easily prepared, and easily taken. Mostly, all the required ingredients can be found within your household.</p>
