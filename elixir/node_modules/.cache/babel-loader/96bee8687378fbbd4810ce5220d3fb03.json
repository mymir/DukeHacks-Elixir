This system is based not upon disease alone but upon the concept of perfect health. Traditional Medicine is a safe alternative approach, a medical system that focuses on preventing disease and treating its root causes. It provides specific advice on proper diet and lifestyle, as well as cleansing and detoxification programs. And unlike modern allopathic drugs, its treatments are tailored to the specific constitution and imbalances of each individual person. Following these guidelines can help prevent future heart attacks, stroke paralysis, or even cancer. It is also useful for chronic conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and sciatica, improving quality of life in a way that modern medicine has not managed to do.
